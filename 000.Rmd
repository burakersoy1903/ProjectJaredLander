Initial Version -- Project / Snapshot
You either Init or Clone a repository
Init -- Master branch -- stored in central repository
Another saved version -- Head -- the current snapshot
Develop branch -- Clone or Pull -- Local -- stored locally
Edits -- Staging
Save Edits -- Commit -- Include comments
Commits area added to Head
After all Staging and Commits -- 3 part process
Because Master branch may be changed by other developers
Pull the Current Master -- Merge with Local -- Push and create Current Master
Tag or version numbering -- Release version -- v0.2.0
Repository -- Whole sequence of events from the initialization, the cloning, all of those staging edits, commits, updating master branch, pull, merge, push

Chapter 04 -- 02092018 ---------------------------------------------------------
Basics of R---------------------------------------------------------------------
We begin with the "hello, world!" of basic math: 1+1 
PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction)
Chapter 04.2 --
Variable names cannot start with number or underscore
Variable names are case sensetive
Chapter 04.3 --
Data types: numeric, character (string), Date/POSIXct (time-based), logical (TRUE/FALSE)
Numeric is like float or double (handles integers and decimals)
Integer is a numeric data type
Character data can be Character or Factor -- factor is a vector
Date data can be Date (just date) or POSIXct (date and time)
Date packages: lubridate and chron
Logical data -- Be careful about using "T" or "F" as a variable name
TRUE and FALSE (all uppercase) are objets and different than True and False
Chapter 04.4 --
Vectors cannot be of mixed type
Vectors are not simple containers -- R is a vectorized language
That means operations are applied to each element of the vector automatically
No column or row vectors -- They are called one-dimensional matrices

Chapter 04.4.1 -- 02122018 -----------------------------------------------------
Basic Math----------------------------------------------------------------------
The most common way to create a vector is with c. The "c" stands for combine becaue multiple elements are being combined into a vector
c function vs : operator
: operator generates a squence of consecutive numbers, in either direction
[StartValue] : [FinishValue]
use length function to learn, number of elements (Loops in future?)
Be careful about operating on two unequal vectors -- the shorter one gets recycled
Short vector repeats every element in order untill all matched
Any and All functions for any or all elements are True
Accessing any element is like arrays -- more functionality
Factors are drastically reduce the size of the variable because they are storing only the unique values

Chapter 04.5 -- 02132018 -------------------------------------------------------
Calling Functions---------------------------------------------------------------
Mean fucntion accepts a vector as an argument, in its simplest form
Using their name with an equal sign -- ??? argument?
Missing adata -- NA is different than NULL
Statistical programs use various techniques to represent missing data such as dash, a period, or even the number 99.
R uses NA.
Be careful about function behaviours with NA, such as mean returns NA
Handling missing data is an important part of statistical analysis
Popular technique: Multiple Imputation -- Chapter 25 -- packages: mi,mice,Amelia
NA missingness vs. NULL nothingness
NULL is atomical and cannot exist within a vector
IF used inside a vector, it simply disappears
Pipes are intersting -- A different way of function calling in magrittr package

Chapter 05 -- 02232018 ---------------------------------------------------------
Advanced Data Structures--------------------------------------------------------
Most common: data.frame, matrix, list, array
Data.frame is one of the most cited reasons for R's ease of use
Each column is a variable and each row is an observation
Every column is a vector -- Within a column each elemnt must be of the same type
However, every column may hold a different data type

Chapter 05.2 -- 03202018 -------------------------------------------------------
Lists---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Structures so far: Vectors, Factors, Data.Frames, and Lists (now)
Often a container needed to hold arbitrary objects of either the same type or varying types.
Lists store any number of items of any type.
You can append elements to lists as much as you want, but it is very computatinally expensive.
So it is best to create a list as long as its final desired size and the fill it in using appropriate indices.

Chapter 05.3 -- 03212018 -------------------------------------------------------
Matrices------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Structures so far: Vectors, Factors, Data.Frames, Lists, and Matrices (now)
Matrices are similar to data.frames, but they are rectangular and same data type for every row and column
They also act like vectors with element-by-element math operations (addition, subtraction,etc)
5 rows 2 columns 5x2 matrix
Matrices can be filled by rows or columns
Multiplying matrices (x) is not the same as matrix multiplication (%*%)
Remember the farmer with 2 lots that grow 3 products (2x3 matrix) and 3 products that sell in 2 markets (3x2 matrix)
The profit matrix as a result of the two matrices above will be 2X2
Matrix multiplication requires the number of columns of the left-hand matrix to be the same as the number of rows of the right-hand matrix
You can tanspose matrices by t() -- Big fish vs tall building metaphor (Wide vs. Long Data) (Wide form  vs. Long form of Data)
Chapter 05.4 --
Data Structures so far: Vectors, Factors, Data.Frames, Lists, Matrices, and Arrays (now)
Array is a multidimensional vector
It must all be of the same type
Only Data.Frames and Lists have no data type restrictions!
Matrices are restricted to two dimwnsions, while Arrays can have an arbitrary number

Burak Notes -- 03212018 --------------------------------------------------------
Wide vs. Long Data--------------------------------------------------------------
(http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/) # Got the definition (I think)
Wide data has a column for each variable.
Long-format data has a column for possible variable types and a column for the values of those variables. Long-format data isn’t necessarily only two columns. For example, we might have ozone measurements for each day of the year. In that case, we could have another column for day. In other words, there are different levels of “longness”. The ultimate shape you want to get your data into will depend on what you are doing with it.
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34590173/long-and-wide-data-when-to-use-what) # Learned a lot about R
It turns out that you need wide-format data for some types of data analysis and long-format data for others. In reality, you need long-format data much more commonly than wide-format data. For example, ggplot2 requires long-format data (technically tidy data), plyr requires long-format data, and most modelling functions (such as lm(), glm(), and gam()) require long-format data. But people often find it easier to record their data in wide format.
The overwhelming majority of R functions are designed for long format data.frames input. There are some special domains where wide format (typically matrices or arrays) is more common.
I would suggest reading the tidyr "Tidy Data" vignette [win-yet] (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html). Aside from describing the usage of tidyr it provides some insight into why data is structured in particular ways.
Tidy Data paper from publisher (code included) https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10
The rough answer to the question is that data, during processing, should always be long, and should only be widened for display purposes. Be cautious with this, though, as here "long" refers more to "tidy", rather than the pure long form.
(https://www.r-bloggers.com/tall-big-data-wide-big-data/) # Get confused again :D
In many statistical analyses we can think of n (the number of observations) and p (the number of variables per observation). In most cases, particularly when people refer to big data, n >> p. Thus, we may have 100 million people but we have only 10 potential predictors: tall data. In contrast, we may have only 1,000 individuals but with 50,000 points each coming from a near infrared spectrometry or information from 250,000 SNPs (a type of molecular marker): wide data. Both types of data will keep on growing but are challenging in a different way.
